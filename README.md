### Features

- Classic snake gameplay where you control a snake that grows in length after eating food.
- The game ends when the snake collides with the wall or itself.
- Easy to use keyboard controls (arrow keys).

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually included by default in Python distributions)

### How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your computer.
2. Save the `snake.py` file to your local machine.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the folder containing `snake.py`.
4. Run the following command:

   ```
   python snake.py
   ```

### Controls

- Use the Arrow keys to control the direction of the snake.

### How it works

- The snake and food are drawn on a Tkinter canvas.
- The snake moves automatically in the current direction.
- When the snake eats the food, it grows in length and new food appears at a random location.
- The game ends if the snake runs into the walls or itself.
